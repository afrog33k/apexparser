Apex <> C# - Two Way [Transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler). A Quick 10 Min Video Intro can be found at https://vimeo.com/224927838

I am working on a detail documentation, but for now I assume you are a C# developer who is working on Salesforce.

#### Setting up and Running 

1. Download the whole solution
2. The **ApexSharpDemo** project contains sample code.
2. Set the correct values on SimpleDemo.cs on the above project
2. Run SimpleDemo.cs

This is very early stage Alpha Software use it at your own risk :-).
