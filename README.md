I am working on a detail documentation, but for now I assume you are a C# developer who is working on Salesforce.

#### Setting up and Running 

0. Create a new SF Dev org, get your API Token
1. Download the whole Git Repo
2. Start the Demo Solution
3. Demo Project is the project you want to work on
4. On Setup.cs, set your SF Id, PW, Token

 ```csharp
.WithUserId("You SF Id")
.AndPassword("You SF Password")
.AndToken("Token")
```


This is very early stage Beta Software use it at your own risk :-).
